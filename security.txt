SPRING SECURITY

Authentication
Authorization


Spring Security take cares of most of the attacks.

---top 10 security risks OWASP (open web application security project)---

-acces control

-cryptographic failures (encryption of transferred data)

-Injection: sql injection attacker writes something to trigger the query and get information: which is prevented via prepared statement which needs type when taking input for the query
different types of injection exist

-insecure design

-security misconfiguration: using default configurations

-vulnerable and outdated components

-identification and authentication failures; storing password in database is not a good idea; u can encrypt if you want to store

-missing multi-factor authentication

-software and data integrity

-logging and monitoring failures; put logs in a good manner not too much not less, enough to keep track of security attacks and enough to not to slow down the app

-server side request forgery: transferred data (server to client)is malicious !!
